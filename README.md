My professional protfolio site, demonstating my skills in front end development and showcasing a short description of who I am and some of the projects I've done.

With the design help of [Mehek Contractor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehek-contractor/) My portfolio has been a fun side project to experiment with some more interesting front end effects such as the vanilla CSS parallax effect, and dynamic transparency as the page is scrolled. I intend to continue adding new projects to the showcase and using my portfolio as a place to keep any other fun side projects and coding challenges that I may do.
